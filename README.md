Problem Statement 

--> The HR wants to know the working prefrence of people , like what % of people likes to WFH and what % from WFO 
--> She aslo wants to know Days on which her employess takes the most leave and days on which they are present the most

As the data analyst , our task is not to just provide what the stakeholders are looking but if possible more insights form the data
