Regarding her employees' attendance, AtliQ Technology's HR manager had some concerns. 

Issue Synopsis 

--> HR requests information about employee preferences, such as the percentage of workers who prefer WFH and the percentage from WFO. 
.-> She also desires to know Days when her employees are most present and when they take the most time off 
She also wants to know the percentage of persons getting sick leave (SL) now that the COVID has passed. 

As data analysts, it is our responsibility to provide stakeholders with greater insights from the data they have provided, if feasible, so they may make informed decisions about their business's future.

Fun fact: according to research, MONDAY is the day on which employees arrive the most often, and FRIDAY is the least. 

The WFH matrix will inform the relevant parties of their employee's WFH preference.

Charts come into action when it's too busy to browse through numbers and decisions; they present a vast collection of visuals in a single graphic. 

We have also utilized Trendline to present the trend for the Present% display so that quick analysis is possible.

The trend line is clearly declining, indicating that more people are feeling more at ease working from home. 
In April, the figure was 93.59%; by the end of June, it had dropped to 90.38%.
